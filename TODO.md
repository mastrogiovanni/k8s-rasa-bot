# TODO

- Add description to NOTES in Helm chart
- Delete external charts (also PV: it is in the readme)

- Service is called rasa-nlu (no helm parameters): this because configuration has the name of the service coded.
It should be instead declared in a config map or similar (config/endpoints.yml) and not in the git repo
